<h1>ALL IN 1 ⛳️<br>Unified Time–Liquidity Mapping Engine</h1>

<p>
ALL IN 1 is a deterministic structural framework that encodes institutional reference levels into a synchronized, state-driven mapping layer.  
It auto-draws, extends, freezes, and retires structural levels in real time, aligned to the New York session clock, without obscuring price.
</p>

<p>
No signals. No prediction layer. No automation.  
Context engine only.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Core Architecture</h2>

<p>
Price is evaluated across three coordinated axes: session segmentation, higher-timeframe reference levels, and gap inefficiencies.  
Every element is time-stamped, conditionally extended, and programmatically invalidated when raided.
</p>

<p>
The result is a unified state machine:  
time → level → state → extension → invalidation.
</p>

<p>
Manual drawing is eliminated.  
Level drift is prevented.  
Execution timing becomes standardized across days.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Intraday Session Engine</h2>

<p>
The system tracks Asia, London, New York Morning, Lunch, Afternoon, plus one custom block.  
Each session is exchange-aligned and time-bounded.
</p>

<p>
During an active window, rolling highs and lows are calculated dynamically.  
At session close, the final high and low are frozen and projected forward as horizontal liquidity references.
</p>

<p>
If price trades through a projected level, extension halts precisely at the violation candle.  
If untouched, the level persists into the next trading day.
</p>

<p>
This creates a chronological liquidity map.  
Untouched highs and lows represent pending liquidity.  
Raided levels mark structural interaction events.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>HOD / LOD State Machine</h2>

<p>
Daily range tracking unfolds in three phases:
</p>

<p>
18:00–00:00 NY defines the pre-midnight range.  
At 00:00, this range freezes as the overnight structure.
</p>

<p>
From 00:00 onward, live High of Day and Low of Day tracking begins.  
At 08:30 NY, early expansion is locked as a structural benchmark.
</p>

<p>
Each freeze event stores a discrete structural layer.  
Expansion phases remain visible without retroactive distortion.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Higher Timeframe Reference Logic</h2>

<p>
For each completed day, week, month, quarter, and year:
</p>

<p>
Final highs and lows are captured.  
At the new period open, they project forward as liquidity targets.
</p>

<p>
If raided, extension stops immediately and visual state mutates to completed.  
If untouched, the level remains active.
</p>

<p>
Binary liquidity state: pending or executed.  
No fading. No subjective deletion.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Gap Architecture</h2>

<h3>NWOG — New Week Opening Gap</h3>

<p>
Difference between current week open and prior week close defines a rectangular inefficiency zone.  
The box extends through the entire week and includes midpoint and quarter levels.
</p>

<p>
Midpoint interaction frequently signals partial rebalance.  
Full traversal implies structural closure.
</p>

<h3>RTH Gap</h3>

<p>
Distance between prior Regular Trading Hours close and 09:30 NY open.  
Pre-open reference converts into a defined gap box at 09:30, including midpoint.
</p>

<p>
Used for intraday continuation or reversion context.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>ADR Engine</h2>

<p>
A rolling 5-day average daily range defines statistical expansion boundaries.
</p>

<p>
Symmetrical projections extend from current day extremes and contract dynamically as price expands.  
When one boundary is breached, it marks the raid point and removes the opposite projection.
</p>

<p>
Optional 60–70% threshold reflects realistic exhaustion probabilities rather than full-range expectation.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Custom Time Anchors</h2>

<p>
Up to six programmable open prices may be defined.  
At each timestamp, the open is captured and projected as a horizontal bias reference.
</p>

<p>
These anchors clarify premium/discount alignment and directional conviction relative to structural sweeps.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Alert System</h2>

<p>
Alerts are event-driven and trigger only on structural interaction:
session extremes, higher timeframe highs/lows, gap bounds, ADR boundaries, and custom opens.
</p>

<p>
No predictive triggers.  
No repetitive noise.  
Designed for off-screen structural monitoring.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Replay Integrity</h2>

<p>
All calculations are time-indexed.  
No forward referencing.  
Levels freeze strictly when historical time conditions are met.
</p>

<p>
Replay mirrors live structural evolution.  
No repaint behavior.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Operational Effect</h2>

<p>
Manual chart management is removed.  
Session timing is standardized.  
HTF liquidity cannot be forgotten.  
Decision latency during raids decreases.
</p>

<p>
Structural memory is externalized to the chart layer.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
No trade signals.  
No probability scoring.  
No order execution integration.  
Requires structural literacy.
</p>

<p>
Execution quality and risk discipline remain user-dependent variables.
</p>

<hr>

<h2>System Philosophy</h2>

<p>
Markets distribute liquidity across time segments.  
Structure evolves through raids and inefficiency fills.
</p>

<p>
ALL IN 1 encodes that distribution into deterministic drawing rules.
</p>

<p>
It is not an indicator stack.  
It is a unified structural state engine.
